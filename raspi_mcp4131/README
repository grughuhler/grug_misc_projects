Program raspi_mcp4131 uses spidev to allow a Raspberry Pi to
control an MCP4131 10K digital potentiometer.

You must enable the SPI interface on the Raspberry Pi:

  sudo raspi-config

Pick "Interface Options" and then "SPI" and "Yes" and "Finish". You
might need to reboot.

Build with "make", run and enter "he" to see a list of commands.  For
example, enter "wr 0 40" to select wiper position hex 40.  Valid wiper
positions range from 0 to 80 hex inclusive so a wiper value of hex 40
should result in a P0W Voltage of around 1.6 V.

Connections are as follows:

* RPI SCLK/GPIO11 to MCP4131

RPI                           MCP4131
--------                      -------
3.3V                          Vdd
3.3V                          P0A
GND                           Vss
GND                           P0B
SCLK/GP11                     CS#
MOSI/GP10 -- 2.2K Resistor -- SPI/SPO
MISO/GP09                     SPI/SPO

and measure Volts at MCP4131 P0W.

It is also a good idea to place a 0.1 uF decoupling capacitor
between MCP4131 Vdd and GND.
