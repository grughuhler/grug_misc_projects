This directory contains C and verilog source files for the "mac_fpga"
project for the Tang Nano 9K FPGA and also the mac_fpga_1wire project.
The former uses separate send and receive data lines between a
Raspberry Pi and the FPGA.  The latter uses a single bidirectional
data line.

There are videos about this on YouTube:

Each version has its own Gowin IDE project file:

1. tang_mac_fpga.gprj    (original, 2-wire)
2. mac_fpga_1_wire.gprj  (1-wire)

Open and build the project file you want, and then
use build the software in directory c.

Use mac_command with tang_mac_fpga.gprj and
mac_command1 with mac_fpga_1_wire.gprj.

Note: Pin connections for 1-wire version changed
from previous git.  The regular (2-wire) and the
1-wire versions are now more consistent.

Pin connections for two-wire, original version:

Function FPGA Pin RPI Zero Pin Color I Used
-------- -------- ------------ ------------
CLK        35        GPIO21      Yellow
CMD[1]     41        GPIO20      Green
CMD[0]     42        GPIO16      Blue
DIN        40        GPIO26      Orange
DOUT       34        GPIO19      White
Ground     GND       GND

Pin connections for 1-wire version (note RPI changes):
