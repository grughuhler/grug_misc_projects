This directory contains that is built and tested on a Raspberry Pi
Zero (but should work on other Raspberry Pis).

There are two program:

One for the 2-wire version of the project: mac_command
and one for the 1-wire (bidirectional) verison: mac_command1.

These programs use the pigpio library so

   sudo apt install libpigpio-dev

Then, just "make" to build on the Raspberry Pi.  Take a look at the
Makefile.  It builds two versions of the program: mac_command1 uses a
single birectional signal while mac_command uses two unidirectional
signals.  The two use slightly different pins, so pay attention to
that and be sure to use the correct program.

Run as root, e.g. sudo ./mac_command.

Type "help" to see a list of commands.

Tested on Raspbian 10 and 12.

Be careful that the Raspberry Pi and the FPGA are not confgured as
outputs at the same time.  That could damage hardware.

For mac_command1, I tested with the iop signal connected between the
Raspberry Pi and the Tang Nano 9K via a 1k resistor.  This works and
may provide protection when both are outputs due to error.  But,
still, avoid conflicting outputs.  The use of the resistor is
paranoia.
