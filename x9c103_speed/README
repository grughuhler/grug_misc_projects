This is the Arduino script that I used to experiment with the x9c103
digital potentiometer.

It accepts commands via serial port.

Enter 0 to 99 to command the pot to a particular position.

Enter tN to set the INCR# delay to 2*N, for example t10 for 20 usec of time
for an INCR# cycle.  The timing is not perfectly consistent.

For example, pick an INCR# delay and then do a 0 followed by a 99 to
see how smoothly the wiper volate rises.

For me, it is jagged with minimum delay (t1) but smooth with a delay
chosen by a conservative reading of the datasheet (t50).  In my test, the
signal can look good with t10 (20 usec INCR# cycle time), but I don't
know that the datasheet makes any such guarantee.
