./strange_led_blink: https://youtu.be/cAwbOCInDKU?si=pxm3Q6C_8n0aAkrE
  This Tang Nano 9K project demonstrates some clock-related Gowin
  hard IP clocks, using them to blink an LED.  Note the project source
  and file names do not match the video.  I did some cleaning up before
  uploading to github.

./raspi_mcp4131: https://youtu.be/KReZy8y35OM
  This video discusses how the MCP4131 digital potentiomer uses SPI
  in an unusual bidirectional way.  It also shows how to use SPIDEV
  on a Raspberry Pi (model Zero tested) to command the MCP4131.

                      https://youtu.be/pj_xLoxf1hY
 These videos are about doing arithmetic on the Tang Nano 9K with
 data stored in shift registers.  The FPGA is commanded by software
 on a Raspberry Pi Zero (other models should work also).  In the
 first video, there are two unidirectional data lines between the
 RPI and the FPGA.  In the second, there is a single bidirectional
 data line.  This repo is a cleaned up and expanded of the repo
 referenced in the original videos.  Use this one.
