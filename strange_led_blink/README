This project blinks an LED on the Tang Nano 9K FPGA development board
a strange way.  Really, it is a demonstration of some Gowin
clock-related hard IP blocks, specificially:

1. OSC: which is used to produce osc_to_pll 3.125 MHz

2. rPLL: which is used to produce:

   * pll_clk_out 9.375 MHz which is sent to pin 31 for scope viewing

   * pll_clkd_out 0.9375 MHz which is sent a chain of 6 CLKDIVs, each
      divides by 8.  This signal is also sent to pin 32.
 
3. CLKDIV set to divide by 8.

In the end, the LED on pin 10 blicks at 3.6 Hz.

Last tested using the educational version of the Gowin IDE version
V1.9.9.03 build 73833.
